# Visualizations

- Suggested for running **snowCrab** + **streaming** locally: `npm install http-server -g && http-server ./`. 
  - Then navigate to the `.html` file

- For `gradient.py`: `pip install Pillow`
  - You might want a virtual environment
  - _I_ might want to add a `requirements.txt` file
